Tasks To Be Performed:
1.
a. Create a user account that can login to the console
b. Create a group and make sure that the group can only launch and
stop EC2 instances using that previously created account.

2.
a. Provide permission to let the user of a previously created account to
create VPCs, Subnets, NACL and security groups
b. Further add the permission so that the user can create RDS instance
c. Explore security options to protect the AWS resources and secure
the permissions

Steps:

1. Create user account using by IAM service
2. Create user group and allowe the permission to user

4. {
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:StartInstances",
        "ec2:StopInstances",
        "ec2:DescribeInstances"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}

5. Name the particular policy and create and you can access the EC2 machine by giving allow and stop permission

 Task 2: Add VPC, Subnet, NACL, Security Group, and RDS Permissions
 a. Extend permissions to allow VPC and networking setup
Go to IAM → Policies → Create Policy

7. {
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [

        "ec2:CreateVpc",
        "ec2:CreateSubnet",
        "ec2:CreateSecurityGroup",
        "ec2:CreateNetworkAcl",
        "ec2:CreateNetworkAclEntry",
        "ec2:Describe*"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
